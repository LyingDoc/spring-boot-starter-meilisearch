# spring-boot-starter-meilisearch
Currently, I'm writing a spring-boot-starter-meilisearch (a combination of meisearch-java (0.15.0) and spring boot (2.17.8)) SDK on my own. I'm out of ideas for the next version's improvement. I'd like to invite all my relatives and friends to help improve this code together, making spring-boot-starter-meilisearch easier and faster to use.
